Consensus Chess renders the board using [pixel chess](https://dani-maccari.itch.io/pixel-chess) - a free asset pack by [DANI MACCARI](https://dani-maccari.itch.io/). I loved it as soon as I saw it.

Credit also to [Maximum Code](https://www.youtube.com/@MaximumCode) for their [SkiaSharp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iJCUIdEBRE) - it's a great resource and I'm grateful for it.
