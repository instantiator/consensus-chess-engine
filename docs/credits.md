## Graphics

Consensus Chess renders the board using [pixel chess](https://dani-maccari.itch.io/pixel-chess) - a free asset pack by [DANI MACCARI](https://dani-maccari.itch.io/). I loved it as soon as I saw it.

Credit also to [Maximum Code](https://www.youtube.com/@MaximumCode) for their [SkiaSharp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iJCUIdEBRE) - it's a great resource and I'm grateful for it.

## Libraries

Huge thanks to [Guillaume Lacasa](https://github.com/glacasa), developer of [Mastonet](https://github.com/glacasa/Mastonet), for his kind work to expose the Mastodon rate limit header information (see: [issue #85](https://github.com/glacasa/Mastonet/issues/85)).

Thanks also to [Sviatoslav](https://github.com/Geras1mleo), developer of this [Chess](https://github.com/Geras1mleo/Chess) library, for so quickly responding to my bug report, and so graciously accepting the pull request I made (see: [issue #5](https://github.com/Geras1mleo/Chess/issues/5)).
